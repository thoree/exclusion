How to run the example:
1)Pedigrees:  Load Claim pedigree, mother-daughter.ped, and then
True ped, sisters.ped.
2) Genetic data: Load database.csv,
tick <Tab>, Column Headers, Row Headers, OK
3) Results: Compute to get 
exclusion probabilities of PE1 = 0.0312 and PE2 =0.0128
p = 0.5
PE1.eq = 2*0.25*p^2*(1-p)^2
p =  0.8
PE2.eq = 2*0.25*p^2*(1-p)^2
